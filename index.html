                    <br>
                    <h3>Online Listing Platforms and Real Estate Websites</h3>
                    <p>Online listing platforms and real estate websites are convenient and accessible resources for exploring commercial properties. Websites like LoopNet, Zillow, and CommercialSearch allow you to search for properties based on location, property type, size, and price range.
